# mineStealth
This plugin makes players that are added to the stealth list invisible to normal players. They can't talk, their join messages are surpressed, and they're put in spectator. Additionally, the scoreboard is nuked for non-stealth players because I couldn't figure out how to remove specific players.

Use it with /stealth [add/remove] <username>
